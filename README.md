# Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks

The `cgcnn` file and `main.py` contain the core code of CGCNN. The `Dataset` file contains information about the datasets we use.

In `SelfAttention and CGCNN.py`, we use SelfAttention first and then CGCNN.

In `SelfAttention or CGCNN.py`, we choose one of SelfAttention and CGCNN to use.

In `mainML.py`, we use traditional machine learning methods for training.
